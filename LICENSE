Freedom Through Transparency
Knowledge—and the code that shapes our digital world—must be open to inspection, 
understanding, and improvement by everyone. Transparency builds trust, 
accountability, and better software.
Open-source levels the playing field: students, startups, and nonprofits gain access 
to tools without prohibitive costs. This democratization empowers voices that would 
otherwise be unheard.
